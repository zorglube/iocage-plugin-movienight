# iocage-plugin-movienight

This project is the [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com) / [FreeNAS](https://www.freenas.org) plugin deployment of [MovieNight](https://github.com/zorglube/MovieNight). It will create a jail, with [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/), `Git` and `Bash` inside. `Git` will be used to download (git clone) the MovieNight (MN) code, after that that the MN binary will le build wit Go.

## Status

This script has been built under TrueNAS 12.1. It should work for FreeNAS 11.X and superior, and it should also work with TrueNAS 12.X and superior. Feel free to report any bad operation or purpose any improvement through the [issues](https://github.com/zorglube/iocage-plugin-movienight/issues) page.

### Prerequisites

MovieNight don't need to access any data outside of the jail. At this point MovieNight need a GO runtime, the runtime will be installed into the Jail by the deployment script.

### Installation

Normally you should find MovieNight into the Plugin list from the TrueNAS management. If you can't use this solution, you may try the manual installation of the plugin [ref](https://github.com/freenas/iocage-ix-plugins).

### Execution

Once you've install the GUI should be accessible buy opening `http://JAIL_IP:8089`.

## Movie Night running configuration

I strongly recommend you to read the MovieNight manual and update the settings, by opening an console into the jail, editing `/usr/local/etc/movienight/settings.json` and restart the Jail.
